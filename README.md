# Communication  

**Q3a:** How can your group communicate when doing the Full Stack Group Project?  
**Q3b:** What are the usernames of each group member on that platform?  
**Q3c:** What is your group’s expected response time to messages?  


*We will use Discord for daily communication and quick questions. For live collaborations, we’ll use Zoom for screen sharing.*  

*Usernames:*  
*Ashika - ashikashekar_51077*  
*Inemesit - inemesit*  
*Riya - hollywoodg*  
*Joy - eowyn8170*  


*Our expected response time will be within 2 hours during weekdays (9am-9pm) and within 4 hours on weekends. For urgent issues blocking progress, we'll use Discord's @everyone feature and expect response within 30 minutes during agreed working hours.*

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

**Example:**  
*If there is a disagreement on technical direction or feature implementation, we will first discuss pros and cons as a group. If consensus can't be reached, we'll document both options and consult our TA during office hours for guidance. For design decisions, we'll use majority vote (3 out of 4). Joy, as project lead, will have tie-breaking authority only after thorough discussion.*  

*If team members are not meeting agreed-upon deadlines or contributing their share, we will first check in privately to see if they're facing obstacles (personal issues, technical blockers, workload from other classes). We'll offer help and adjust tasks if needed. If lack of contribution continues after this check-in, the group will have a meeting to formally remind them of their commitments and set clear expectations for the next sprint. If the pattern persists after two warnings, we'll document the situation and bring it to the TA's attention.*

# Full Stack Group Project Track  
---

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** 
*Generative AI assistants make it easy to get instant answers, but constant reliance can weaken problem solving and critical thinking. Many students and professionals aren’t aware of how much they depend on AI tools day by day, and this invisible overuse may lead to cognitive offloading and skill decline over time.*

**Solution 1:** 

*AI Usage Reflection Platform is a web dashboard that helps users visualize and understand their AI usage patterns. A lightweight browser extension tracks when someone interacts with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.), while the React frontend displays daily and weekly statistics with clear visualizations. A Flask backend stores usage data with full user privacy controls and provides non-judgmental reflection prompts encouraging users to think about their patterns. The platform focuses on transparency and self-awareness, not prescribing limits or shaming users.*

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:** UIC students often live away from family and established support networks. They run into small but urgent problems like moving dorm furniture, carrying groceries, jumping a car battery, getting quick help with a tough homework concept but existing options don’t fit. Formal volunteer platforms expect long-term commitments and background checks. Social media posts get lost in feeds, and apps like Nextdoor skew toward older homeowners, not students.

This leaves many feeling isolated and struggling alone with tasks that peers could easily help with in minutes. New students, international students, and those with mobility limitations are hit hardest. Traditional mutual aid networks require knowing the right group chats or friends. there’s no dedicated UIC space for quick, safe, one-time help.


**Solution 2:** Mutual Aid is a closed, UIC-verified platform where students can post and claim small, time-bounded tasks. It uses a lightweight credit system to encourage reciprocity while keeping the spirit of mutual aid: help should flow easily in a trusted community. By limiting membership to those with a valid @uic.edu email, the platform builds density and safety among peers.

**Problem 3:**  UIC students possess valuable skills but lack platforms to exchange them. A computer science student who needs guitar lessons can't easily connect with a music student who needs coding help. Students either pay for services they can't afford or go without assistance. While informal skill trading happens through friend groups, there's no system to match students across campus based on complementary needs, resulting in missed opportunities for learning and collaboration.

**Solution 3:** SkillSwap is a UIC-exclusive platform where students list skills they offer and skills they need, then get matched with complementary partners. A smart algorithm suggests exchanges (e.g., "Alex offers Python tutoring and needs Spanish practice" matches with "Maria offers Spanish tutoring and needs coding help"). Students send proposals, negotiate terms, and coordinate through built-in messaging. The platform requires UIC email verification for safety, includes post-exchange ratings, and supports both in-person campus meetings and virtual sessions. This makes tutoring and skill-building accessible regardless of financial means while connecting students across majors and backgrounds.


# Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4: Immigrant and diaspora families in Chicago carry recipes that represent more than just food, they're cultural artifacts documenting migration journeys, adaptations to new environments, and family resilience. When elder family members pass away, these recipes and the stories behind them often disappear. Children of immigrants grow up eating traditional dishes but don't learn the cultural context, ingredient substitutions made due to availability, or the memories tied to specific meals.Traditional recipe apps focus on cooking instructions but strip away the cultural narrative. Family recipes get texted in fragmented WhatsApp messages, scribbled on index cards that get lost, or exist only in the cook's memory. Second and third-generation Americans lose connection to their heritage because the stories behind the food aren't preserved alongside the ingredients.This is particularly acute in Chicago, one of America's most diverse cities, where neighborhoods contain concentrated populations from specific regions (Polish in Jefferson Park, Mexican in Pilsen, South Asian in West Ridge, South Asian/Indian, Pakistani in Devon, Italian - little village, African American/Soul food - Bronzeville, Greek/Mediterranean - Greektown etc.). These communities hold incredible culinary knowledge that isn't being systematically documented.**

**Implementation 4: Migration Memory Cookbook is a multimedia storytelling platform where immigrant and diaspora families document recipes alongside migration stories, cultural context, and adaptations made across generations. Each recipe becomes a narrative artifact connecting past and present.**

**Idea - Story - Inspiration 5: Chicago neighborhoods each tell distinct stories through their street names, but most residents don't know the history behind them. Why is there a street named after Ida B. Wells? Who was Pulaski? These names represent important historical figures, cultural milestones, and neighborhood transformations, but the knowledge exists only in historical archives or local historians' memories. Newcomers to Chicago navigate streets daily without understanding the cultural heritage encoded in the names. This creates a disconnect between residents and the rich history beneath their feet, particularly in immigrant and minority communities whose contributions are commemorated in street names but forgotten in popular memory.**


**Implementation 5: Chicago Street Stories is an interactive map based storytelling platform that brings street name histories to life. Users explore an interactive map of Chicago where clicking any street reveals its naming origin, historical significance, and connection to neighborhood culture. Each street profile includes the biography of the person it's named after (with photos and key accomplishments), the historical event or cultural significance it commemorates, how the name has changed over time (many streets were renamed), and stories from residents about what that street means to their community.**


# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

We are going with Track 1: AI Overuse Awareness. This is the project we are going with because we think it would be interesting that in a time where there is so much reliance on AI among college students, it would be enlightening to see just how much people are dependent on openAI.


# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**

PostgreSQL. It handles growing datasets better than SQLite. Our data also has clear relationships that benefit from a relational model

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**

PostgreSQL will store all usage events, user accounts, and generated AI insight. We’ll have tables for users, events (each time they interact with AI tools), and insights (optional summaries generated with OpenAI). The schema will let us query usage by time, tool type, or frequency to power the dashboard graphs. Indexes will be added on user_id and timestamps for fast filtering and time series charts. Relationships between tables will ensure data integrity when deleting or updating user records.

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**

We plan to integrate two third-party APIs. The primary integration is the OpenAI API, which we'll use to generate personalized reflection summaries based on usage patterns. When a user clicks the "Generate Insights" button on their dashboard, we'll send aggregated statistics to OpenAI's completion endpoint, receiving back natural language insights like "Your usage peaks during late night coding sessions, suggesting AI might be compensating for fatigue" or "You rarely use AI for brainstorming compared to direct problem-solving, which might indicate missed opportunities for creative exploration." This feature is completely opt-in and users can delete generated insights at any time. Our secondary integration is Mailjet for transactional emails, specifically weekly reflection prompt digests. These emails will include basic usage statistics and gentle questions encouraging self-reflection, delivered on a schedule the user controls.

**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**

Yes. OpenAI uses dynamic rate limits that vary by account and model. New free accounts typically start with very low limits (about 3 requests per minute and ~200 requests per day), but exact limits are shown in the OpenAI dashboard and can increase with usage or paid tiers. We’ll monitor our limits in the dashboard and use a Redis-based queue with exponential backoff to handle bursts and retries if we hit rate limits.
 Mailjet API provides 6,000 emails per month with a daily cap of 200 emails, which should comfortably accommodate our UIC-focused user base. We'll batch weekly digest emails during off-peak hours and implement a queue that defers non-urgent emails if we approach the daily threshold.

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

We'll use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with email/password login. Users register with an email and password, we hash the password with bcrypt, and issue a JWT that expires in 24 hours.

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage, we never store them in plaintext. The JWT secret is stored in environment variables.

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

We will deploy on Render. All sensitive keys (JWT secret, database URL, OpenAI API key, Mailjet API key) will be stored as environment variables in Render’s built-in secret manager, never hardcoded in the codebase or committed to Git.

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**

We will use GitHub Actions for CI/CD so every merge to the main branch triggers an automatic build and redeployment on Render. Before each push, we’ll run automated tests locally.
