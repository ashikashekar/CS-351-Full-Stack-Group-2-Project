# Full Stack Group Project Track

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** 
*Generative AI assistants make it easy to get instant answers, but constant reliance can weaken problem solving and critical thinking. Many students and professionals aren’t aware of how much they depend on AI tools day by day, and this invisible overuse may lead to cognitive offloading and skill decline over time.*

**Solution 1:** 

*AI Usage Reflection Platform is a web dashboard that helps users visualize and understand their AI usage patterns. A lightweight browser extension tracks when someone interacts with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.), while the React frontend displays daily and weekly statistics with clear visualizations. A Flask backend stores usage data with full user privacy controls and provides non-judgmental reflection prompts encouraging users to think about their patterns. The platform focuses on transparency and self-awareness, not prescribing limits or shaming users.*
