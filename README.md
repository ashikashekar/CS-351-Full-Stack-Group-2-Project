# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

**Example:**  
*If there is a disagreement on technical direction or feature implementation, we will first discuss pros and cons as a group. If consensus can't be reached, we'll document both options and consult our TA during office hours for guidance. For design decisions, we'll use majority vote (3 out of 4). Joy, as project lead, will have tie-breaking authority only after thorough discussion.*  

*If team members are not meeting agreed-upon deadlines or contributing their share, we will first check in privately to see if they're facing obstacles (personal issues, technical blockers, workload from other classes). We'll offer help and adjust tasks if needed. If lack of contribution continues after this check-in, the group will have a meeting to formally remind them of their commitments and set clear expectations for the next sprint. If the pattern persists after two warnings, we'll document the situation and bring it to the TA's attention.*
