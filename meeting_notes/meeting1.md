## Agenda
- Brainstorm dashboard layout and analytics features  
- Decide which user metrics to display  
- Plan deliverables 

---

## Discussion Summary

- Agreed on a three-screen flow: **Consent → Welcome → Main Dashboard**.  
- The main screen will display daily / weekly analytics on AI usage.  
- Graphs will visualize time spent using AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot.  
- The consent screen precedes the welcome screen to ensure user privacy compliance.

### **Analytics & Metrics**
- Team debated adding a “dependency score” but chose to focus on **objective metrics** only.  
- Confirmed to show:
  - Total time spent on AI screens  
  - Number of prompts per day / week  
  - List of AI tools used  


- Plan to meet **twice before the deadline** for final adjustments and peer-review prep.
